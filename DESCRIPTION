Description: Utilities for managing tissue microarray (TMA) data. This type of data is relatively low 
 density molecular readouts consisting of individual tissue cores arranged on a slide for antibody-based
 evaluation of target expression. Traditionally, these cores were evaluated by a pathologist and scored
 according to intensity of stain and/or percentage of the cells in the core that were stained. This package
 provides some tools for managing this type of data. Note these are data management utilities rather than 
 analytical utilities.
